                    <h3>Material is the metaphor</h3>
                    <p>The material is grounded in tactile reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink.</p>

                <div class="principle-card">
                    <i class="material-icons">format_bold</i>
                    <h3>Bold, graphic, intentional</h3>
                    <p>Elements and components like typography, grids, space, scale, color, and imagery create hierarchy.</p>

                    <i class="material-icons">motion_photos_on</i>
                    <h3>Motion provides meaning</h3>
                    <p>Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover, with transformations as key interactions.</p>

                    <p>Just make a decision and let it go. In your world you can create anything you desire. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. We'll put a happy little bush here. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. This is your creation - and it's just as unique and special as you are. Here we're limited by the time we have. You can work and carry-on and put lots of little happy things in here. We must be quiet, soft and gentle. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. You can do anything your heart can imagine.That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Let your imagination be your guide. Clouds are free they come and go as they please.</p>

                    <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Happy painting, God bless. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Poor old tree. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. I thought today we would do a happy little picture. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. You can't make a mistake. Anything that happens you can learn to use - and make something beautiful out of it. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring.</p>

                    <p>Imagination is the key to painting. You gotta think like a tree. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. Exercising the imagination, experimenting with talents, being creative; these things, to me, are truly the windows to your soul. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown.</p>
